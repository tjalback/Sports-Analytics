# Sports-Analytics
My own analysis of sports data

This project is on-going. 

I was inspired to start my own project after getting some exposure to sports analytics through a few different mediums. A Tableau webinar presented some visualisations of changing F1 speeds over a car-racing track, as well as a running analysis using self-collected data on a smart watch. While completing the first module of a Coursera course: Foundations in Sports Analytics, interesting analyses such as heat maps for made/missed shots by NBA players, cricket team performance measures and head-to-head game analysis, were presented. I love sports, so it made sense for me to build a passion project. 

Over the last decade, analytics seems to have become an integral part of measuring team or individual success and failure. Players and coaches speak to its usefulness to highlight strengths or improvement areas. Others argue that it is over-emphasized and should be used as one of many tools to inform decisions on and off the court.  

In the repo, I'll be adding some Jupyter notebooks of my own analyses. I wanted to build end-to-end projects, starting by accessing open data on the web through to analysis and visualisation. Some of my intial questions are, why do I like some players over others. Do players who actually perform really well is some aspects of a sport get the same media attention as others. How does player salary actually impact on team performance.
