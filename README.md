# Sports-Analytics
My own analysis of NBA sports data

This project is on-going for fun. 

I was inspired to start my own project after getting some exposure to sports analytics through a few different mediums. A Tableau webinar visualised changing F1 speeds over a car-racing track as well as a running analysis using self-collected data on a smart watch. While completing the first module of a Coursera course: Foundations in Sports Analytics, interesting analyses such as heat maps for made/missed shots by NBA players, cricket team performance measures and head-to-head game analysis, were presented. I love sports, so it made sense for me to investigate this as a project. 

Over the last decade, analytics seems to have become an integral part of measuring team or individual success and failure. Players and coaches speak to its usefulness to highlight strengths or improvement areas. Others argue that it is over-emphasized and should be used only as one of many tools to inform decisions on and off the court.  

In the repo, I've added a Python Notebook and I wanted to build end-to-end projects, starting by accessing available data through to analysis and visualisation.
